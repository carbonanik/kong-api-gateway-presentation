## Key Technical Points

### Kong Gateway Features
- **JWT Authentication**: Validates tokens before routing
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per minute per client
- **Request Routing**: Path-based routing to services
- **Logging**: Comprehensive request/response logging

### Service Responsibilities
- **Customer**: User registration, login, JWT generation
- **Order**: Order management (protected endpoints)
- **Payment**: Payment processing (protected)
- **Cache**: Redis-based caching (protected)
- **Chat**: Real-time messaging (protected)
- **File**: File upload/management (protected)

### Security Layers
1. **Network**: Docker network isolation
2. **Gateway**: JWT validation, rate limiting
3. **Service**: Password hashing, input validation
4. **Data**: Database access control

## Demo Commands (Quick Reference)

```bash
# Start services
sudo docker-compose up -d

# Register user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/customer/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"demo","password":"demo123"}'

# Login and get JWT
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/customer/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"demo","password":"demo123"}' | jq -r '.token')

# Test protected endpoint (should fail)
curl -i http://localhost:8000/order/123

# Test protected endpoint (should succeed)
curl -i http://localhost:8000/order/123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Common Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: Why microservices instead of monolith?
**A**: Better scalability, maintainability, team organization. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### Q: How do you handle service-to-service communication?
**A**: Services communicate through Kong Gateway, which handles routing and authentication. For direct communication, we use internal Docker networking.

### Q: How do you ensure data consistency across services?
**A**: Each service manages its own data. For cross-service consistency, we implement eventual consistency patterns and event-driven architecture.

### Q: How do you handle failures and circuit breakers?
**A**: Kong Gateway provides health checks and can implement circuit breakers. Services are designed to fail gracefully.

### Q: How do you secure sensitive data?
**A**: Passwords hashed with bcrypt, JWT tokens with short expiration, rate limiting, internal Docker networks.

### Q: How do you monitor and debug the system?
**A**: Kong Gateway provides comprehensive logging. Each service logs activities. Can implement centralized monitoring with Prometheus.
