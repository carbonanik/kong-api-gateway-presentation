# Interview Presentation - Node.js Microservices with Kong Gateway

## Presentation Outline (15-20 minutes)

### 1. Introduction (2 minutes)
**"I've built a complete microservices architecture using Node.js and Kong Gateway"**

- **Project Overview**: 6 microservices (Cache, Customer, Order, Payment, Chat, File)
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Redis, Kong Gateway, Docker
- **Architecture**: API Gateway pattern with service isolation

### 2. Architecture Deep Dive (5 minutes)

#### System Architecture
```
Client → Kong Gateway → Microservices → Databases
```

**Key Components:**
- **Kong Gateway**: Central entry point, handles authentication, rate limiting
- **6 Microservices**: Each with specific business logic
- **Databases**: MongoDB for persistent data, Redis for caching
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment for scalability

#### Service Responsibilities
- **Customer Service**: User registration, authentication, JWT generation
- **Order Service**: Order management with protected endpoints
- **Payment Service**: Payment processing
- **Cache Service**: Redis-based caching
- **Chat Service**: Real-time messaging
- **File Service**: File upload/management

### 3. Security Implementation (4 minutes)

#### Multi-Layer Security
1. **API Gateway Security (Kong)**
   - JWT Authentication
   - Rate Limiting (100 req/min)
   - Request routing and validation

2. **Service-Level Security**
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - JWT token generation and validation
   - Input validation and sanitization

3. **Network Security**
   - Docker network isolation
   - Internal service communication
   - Port exposure control

#### Authentication Flow
```
Register → Login → JWT Token → Protected API Access
```

### 4. Technical Implementation (4 minutes)

#### Code Structure
```

├── gateway/kong.yaml          # Kong configuration
├── services/                  # 6 microservices

├── docker-compose.yml        # Container orchestration
└── README.md                 # Documentation
```

#### Key Features Demonstrated
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication with 1-hour expiration
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API abuse
- **Service Isolation**: Each service in separate container
- **Database Integration**: MongoDB for users, Redis for caching
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses

### 5. Live Demo (3 minutes)

#### Demo Script
1. **Show Running Services**
   ```bash
   sudo docker-compose ps
   ```

2. **Test Authentication Flow**
   ```bash
   # Register user
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/customer/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"demo","password":"demo123"}'
   
   # Login and get JWT
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/customer/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"demo","password":"demo123"}'
   ```

3. **Test Protected Endpoints**
   ```bash
   # Without JWT (should fail)
   curl -i http://localhost:8000/order/123
   
   # With JWT (should succeed)
   curl -i http://localhost:8000/order/123 \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>"
   ```

4. **Show Rate Limiting**
   ```bash
   # Multiple requests to show rate limiting headers
   curl -i http://localhost:8000/order/123 \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>"
   ```

### 6. Benefits and Advantages (2 minutes)

#### Scalability
- **Independent Scaling**: Each service can scale independently
- **Load Balancing**: Kong Gateway handles traffic distribution
- **Container Orchestration**: Easy deployment and management

#### Maintainability
- **Service Isolation**: Changes to one service don't affect others
- **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use different technologies
- **Team Organization**: Different teams can work on different services

#### Security
- **Centralized Security**: Kong Gateway enforces security policies
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### 7. Future Enhancements (1 minute)

#### Production Ready Features
- **HTTPS/TLS**: SSL termination in Kong
- **Database Authentication**: MongoDB and Redis auth
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana integration
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with ELK stack
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipeline

## Key Talking Points for Q&A

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why did you choose Kong Gateway?**
A: Kong provides enterprise-grade API management with built-in security, rate limiting, and monitoring. It's highly scalable and has excellent documentation.

**Q: How do you handle service-to-service communication?**
A: Services communicate through Kong Gateway, which handles routing and authentication. For direct service communication, we use internal Docker networking.

**Q: How do you ensure data consistency across services?**
A: Each service manages its own data. For cross-service consistency, we implement eventual consistency patterns and event-driven architecture.

**Q: How do you handle failures and circuit breakers?**
A: Kong Gateway provides health checks and can implement circuit breakers. Services are designed to fail gracefully and return appropriate error responses.

### Security Questions

**Q: How do you secure sensitive data?**
A: Passwords are hashed with bcrypt, JWT tokens have short expiration, rate limiting prevents abuse, and all communication is over internal Docker networks.

**Q: How do you handle token refresh?**
A: JWT tokens expire after 1 hour. Users need to re-authenticate to get new tokens. For production, we'd implement refresh tokens.

**Q: How do you prevent JWT token theft?**
A: Tokens are transmitted over HTTPS, have short expiration, and are validated on every request. We also implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.

### Architecture Questions

**Q: Why microservices instead of monolith?**
A: Microservices provide better scalability, maintainability, and team organization. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

**Q: How do you handle database transactions across services?**
A: Each service manages its own database. For distributed transactions, we use saga patterns or eventual consistency.

**Q: How do you monitor and debug the system?**
A: Kong Gateway provides comprehensive logging. Each service logs its activities, and we can implement centralized monitoring with tools like Prometheus.
